# ‚ö° Wallace Multiplier (Verilog)

This project implements a **Wallace tree multiplier** in **Verilog HDL**.  
The Wallace tree is a fast hardware multiplier that reduces the number of sequential addition steps by using parallel carry-save adders, significantly improving speed over traditional array multipliers.
